# Hello World (Python)

This is the classic "Hello, World!" program — but done the right way.

Instead of just a one-liner, this version uses a proper `main()` function and includes a conditional entry point (`if __name__ == "__main__"`), which makes it clean, modular, and reusable as part of a larger codebase if needed.

Yeah, it's simple — but it's structured. Because even small things deserve to be written with care.
