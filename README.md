# 🐍 Python Portfolio

Hey, welcome.

This is a collection of Python projects I'm building as part of my learning and practice.
I'm putting in the effort to keep things clean, well-organized, and properly structured — but at the end of the day, this is also a side quest I'm doing because I enjoy it.

Each project here has its own README and dependencies (if needed), and I’m trying to keep everything modular and lightweight.

# 📚 Projects

Title: Hello World

Directory name: /Python_Portfolio/Hello/

Description: A classic, basic greeting. We all started here.

------------------------------------------------------------


(More projects coming soon.)	Stay tuned.

# 🛠️ Tools and Practices

    Python 3.x

    Virtual environments (venv)

    Linting with flake8, formatting with black, sorting imports with isort

    Following PEP8 style guidelines

    Keeping the repo modular and easy to navigate

# 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/ElJafo/Python_Portfolio.git
cd Python_Portfolio

Set up your environment:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then just dive into any project folder you want.

# ✨ About Me

I'm Jafo.
Coding is one of the ways I like to build things, challenge myself, and keep learning.
This portfolio is me documenting that — clean code, a bit of chaos, a lot of curiosity. I had learned Python years ago but I'm trying to re-learn it and build a portfolio along the way.

# 📝 Notes

New projects will be added over time, depending on how life (and side quests) go.
Thanks for passing by.
